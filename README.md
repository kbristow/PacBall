# Overview
PacBall is an implementation of a simple Pacman style game using only the java.awt and javax.swing libraries.
I would not recommend using java.awt for games and instead suggest LibGdx for java users.
However, where LibGdx is not available, or out of interest, this project serves as an example of how simple games using java.awt can be 
implemented.

# How To Play
W A S D control the characters movement. The goal of the game is to eat all the pellets whilst avoiding the enemy balls. 
Players can customise the level using the l1 file and following the same design elements (note: levels must be 16 x 16).

# Requirements
- Eclipse Kepler with Java 1.6 was used to set the project up.
- Compiling from source should be straight forward as there are no external dependencies.
